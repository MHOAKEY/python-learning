# 1. Create a function that reverses a string but does not use any built in Python string functions. The function will take a string and return the reversed string

# example:
# string = "Good morning"
# answer = "gninrom dooG"


# 2. Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the largest and smallest numbers in the array.
# Special Rule: You cannot sort the array to accomplish this task.

# Example:
# array = [ 5, 8, 1, 19, 7, 4, 6 ]
# answer = Largest: 19 Smallest: 1


# 3. Given an array of int and a target int, find the index of the 2 values in the array that sum the target.

# example:
# intArray = [1,2,3,4,5]
# targetInt = 5
# answer = index 1 and 2 or index 0 and 3


# 4. Write a function that takes in 2 strings and finds out if they are anagrams of eachother.

# Function must take 2 arguments. Each of them a string.
# Function must find of if they are anagrams
# Function must return true or false
