# Create a program that calculates the price for custom desks
# The program will take specifications from the user:
# length, width, wood type (mahogany, oak, pine), and how many drawers

# There is a minimum cost of $200 for any desk

# There is a large surface additional cost of $50 if the surface is over 750 square inches

# Mahogany has an additional cost of $150,
# Oak has an additional cost of $125,
# and Pine is free.
# Drawers cost $30 each

# the program should take all the inputs from the user and then display the price for the custom desk.
