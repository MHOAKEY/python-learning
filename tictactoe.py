# Build a Tic Tac Toe game in python
# - 2 Human players
# - One player selects a space. If the space is not taken then the space is assigned with X or O depending on the player
# - If the space is taken then the user is asked to choose a different space
# - Display the state of the board to the players after each move
# - You will likely want to check for a win condition after each turn instead of waiting until the end
# - Make sure that all win conditions are checked for (row, column, diagonal)
# - Display the winner to the users unless game is a tie, in which case just display that it was a tie.

# Bonus points:
# - Add ability to start over after game is finished without having to run the program again
# - Make the game have an Ai that can play a single human player
